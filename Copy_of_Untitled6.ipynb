        "Tuples are ideal for storing patient vitals because:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Immutability:** Once created, the elements of a tuple cannot be changed. This is crucial for medical records where data integrity is paramount. You wouldn't want a patient's recorded vitals to be accidentally altered.\n",
        "*   **Data Integrity:** The immutability ensures that a specific set of vitals (like blood pressure and heart rate taken at a particular time) remains constant as an unchangeable record.\n",
        "*   **Ordered Collection:** Tuples maintain the order of elements, which is important for consistently representing vital signs (e.g., always knowing the heart rate is the fourth element).\n",
        "*   **Heterogeneous Data:** Tuples can store different data types (e.g., string for name, integer for age, float for blood pressure), which is necessary for patient vital records.\n",
        "*   **Read-Only Access:** They are optimized for read-only operations, making them efficient for retrieving historical vital records."
